# Code of Conduct

### Working on Task

*Never push directly to developer or master*

*Never mix refactoring and features in commits*

*Ping developers you've added to reviewers in UI chat or in Private Messages*

#### Flow

1. Create branch

Follow [git-flow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html)
Branch name format: {git-flow-prefix[feature, bugfix, refactoring]}/{Task_name}/{short-description}

**Example** - *feature/BUTTON_COMPONENT/create-component

2. Commit and push your changes

Commit message has to correspond with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)

**Example** *- feat: added language select to DV360*

**Example** *- fix: horizontal table arrows*

**And others** *- build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:

Add JIRA issue link to description

3. Create PR and merge to develop

If *small changes* assign 1+ UI developers and send to QA.
After 1+ approvals and QA allowance - merge

If *regular changes* assign 1+ UI developers and after 1+ approvals send to QA.
After QA allowance - merge

If *architectural changes* assign all UI developers.
Write your motivation in UI chat and after majority approvals send to QA.

If *urgent fix* send straight to QA and then merge

**Definitions:**

> *small changes -* fixing or modifying small feature. Doesn't have important changes to old logic.

**Examples** - remove console.log, fix type, add some text

> *regular changes -* add/modify feature that changes old logic. New feature that doesn't involve changing other parts
> of the project.

**Examples** - create highlights table, create chart type, add new integration

> *architectural changes -* involves changes in many parts of the project. Or adds new part to the project

**Examples** - New ui library, Huge refactoring

> *urgent fix -* small but important fix that requried by QA or business side.

**Examples** - add ? to object property, add try/catch

## Add new Components

1. Create component folder in src/components.
2. Create folders for stories and tests.
3. Write tests for future component.
4. Create component regarding rules Code style Rules above.
5. Configure storybook for it.
6. Test new component.
7. Add instruction for new component to special README.md file regarding this component category.

For example:
You have created an input component. Find in [COMPONENTS_LIST.md](./MDDescriptions/COMPONENTS_LIST.md) the md file with
the most appropriate category for your component and add your component to that category following the instructions.

For you component in MD file you should provide:

## [COMPONENT_NAME]

### [Component props]

- **prop1**: string - some string value
- **prop2**: boolean - some boolean value
- **prop3**: (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void - some change event handler

### [Component examples]

```js
import { Component } from "gov-ua-ui";

const handelChangeEvent = (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
 ...
}

<Component
  prop1="es"
  prop2={false}
  prop3={handelChangeEvent}
/>
```

# Code Style Rules

*If you work with legacy file - refactor it (if times allow) - **No class components are allowed***

*Don't write as you want - write as it written*

- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code format
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code analyze

```
- Use hooks over HOCs
- Constants should be UPPER_CAMEL_CASE but enums and types in PascalCase
- use `features` abstraction or `pages` for business logic. Any "side effects" like context call, redux, API request etc. is forbidden   
- Use `TODO: and FIXME:` keywords to mark places where changes will be needed later (and don't forget to remove them after being updated)
- Avoid use z-indexes, use only small values if necessary. Huge values is forbidden

### Testing

- Use `react-testing-library` or JEST for creating [BDD tests](https://www.bddtesting.com/)
- All tests should use mocked API calls
- Tests should be honest and repeatable. Any developer should have same results 
- For custom UI elements create `story` in `storybook`

### Naming

- Use *Wrapper for styled wrapper block (examples: IconWrapper, ButtonWrapper)
- Use 'is*' prefix for state naming (examples: isActive, isLight)
- Use 'on*' for defining prop names for handle functions (examples: onChange, onClick)
- Use 'handle*' prefix for defining handle functions (examples: handleSubmitButtonClick, handleNameInputChange)

### Imports and imports order

Always configure and use absolute path for components and pages.

Imports order:
1. Libraries
2. Helpers
3. Components
4. Assets
5. Styles

Exports: 
Each component must be in a folder with an index.(ts|js) file that exports that component.

- Each category devide by line break and sort by string length 

### STYLES

For CSS and SCSS files follow this rules (https://9elements.com/css-rule-order)
1. SASS inheritance (@extend, @mixin, @imports)
2. Generated content (content)
3. Position and Layout (position, z-index, top, bottom, left, right, Flexbox properties, float, clear)
4. Display and Visibility (display, opacity, transform)
5. Clipping (overflow, clip)
6. Animation (animation, transition)
7. Box model (margin, box-shadow, border, border-radius, box-sizing, width, height, padding)
8. Background (background, cursor)
9. Typography (font, color, text e.t.c)
10. Pseudo-classes & pseudo-elements (:hover, :active, :first-child e.t.c.)

For library write styles in common CSS style.  

    <Component
      className="component component__element component__element_modificator"
      ...
      ...
    />

### Components 

There should be always pair:

    <Component
      ...
      onSomething={handleSomething}
      ...
    />

If it is TS project and component has props, component must have interface
with name [ComponentName]Interface{}
 
Example: 
 
const ModalWrapperInterface {
   isOpen: boolean;
   onClose: (e: React.ClickEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => void;
   children: any;
   className?: string:
   overlayClassName?: string;
}
  
const ModalWrapper = ({
                       isOpen,
                       onClose,
                       children,
                       className,
                       overlayClassName
                     }: ModalWrapperInterface): JSX.Element => {
                         return ();
                     }                        

### Communication

- Bring forward your thoughts on weekly UI meeting
- For any *architectural changes* schedule a meetings in UI chat
